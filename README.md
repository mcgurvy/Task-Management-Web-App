# Task-Management-Web-App
Task Management Web App where users can create, update, delete, and view tasks. 
The backend API will be built using Go (Golang) and the frontend using JavaScript (React).

# High-Level Architecture
Frontend (React): A user interface to interact with the task manager. The UI will let users create, view, update, and delete tasks.
Backend (Go): A REST API that provides endpoints for managing tasks (CRUD operations).
Database (SQLite): A lightweight database for storing tasks.
